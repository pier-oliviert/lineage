  ###
  #   Discussion: How the server handles the length of a packet goes as follow:
  #   If a packet is smaller than 256bytes, the high byte is used. If however, the message is
  #   bigger than 256bytes, you use the low byte as a multiplicator. 
  #   The length of a packet is assumed to be: lowByte * 256 + highByte
  #
  #   Discussion: We assume the packet size is at least 4 bytes long. Otherwise, it would disconnect us
  #   from the server. If the packet is less than 4 bytes, we raise an exception and return without sending it
