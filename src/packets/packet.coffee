  # returns the expected length of the buffer.
  # The length is a multiple of 8 since we are
  # using 8 bytes encodings
  # Note:
  #   - You have to overwrite this method
  #   - By default you want to send the opcode(1)

  # Int8Array that is available for work.
  # We are using Int8Array since it's the way the server interprets packet

  # Note:
  #   - The opcode is already filled.
  #   - The high & low byte are already filled based on length()
  #   - You have to overwrite this method
  #   - When your packaging is done. You have to call @packaged(buffer) to notify the callback

  # Don't subclass this method. 
  # Subclass @package instead!

  #   Discussion: Since the encryption is being done using the 4 first byte, a packet has to be
  #   at least 4 bytes wide.
